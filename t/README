README files for the HTTP::Proxy tests

HTTP::Proxy can test itself with using the network,
thanks to the HTTP::Daemon module.

But since I want to test the proxy against "real" servers,
I also need to test it with an internet connection.

localhost tests work as follows:
 - a HTTP::Daemon is created and forked, that will serve
   a certain number of simple requests
 - a HTTP::Proxy is created and forked
 - a LWP::UserAgent is created and connects to the proxy
 - once every child is reaped, tests are run on the 
   log files
