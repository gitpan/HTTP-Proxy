HTTP::Proxy
-----------

This module is a pure Perl HTTP proxy.

Its main use should be to record web sessions, so as to
help users create web robots, and web testing suites.

This module allows the user to modify requests and responses
on the fly, but also to record web sessions. The recorded
sessions can be used to create a robot (with WWW::Mechanize),
or create tree-like structures that represent the user's
journey in cyberspace.
