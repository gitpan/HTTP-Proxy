HTTP::Proxy
-----------

This module is a pure Perl HTTP proxy.

Its main use should be to record and/or modify web sessions, so as to
help users create web robots, web testing suites, as well as proxy
systems than can transparently alter the requests to and answers from
an origin server.

The eg/ directory holds a few examples:
- proxy.pl (simple proxy)
- anonymiser.pl (basic anonymising proxy)

The way the filters are implemented is very likely to change in
the next version of HTTP::Proxy. Expect a dedicated filter class
to appear soon, as well as some slight changes in the HTTP::Proxy
interfaces. This will probably happen in 0.10.
