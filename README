HTTP::Proxy
-----------

This module is a pure Perl HTTP proxy.

Its main use should be to record and/or modify web sessions, so as to
help users create web robots, web testing suites, as well as proxy
systems than can transparently alter the requests to and answer from
an origin server.

This module allows the user to modify requests and responses
on the fly, but also to record web sessions. The recorded
sessions can be used to create a robot (with WWW::Mechanize),
or create tree-like structures that represent the user's
journey in cyberspace.

The eg/ directory holds a few examples:
- proxy.pl (simple proxy)
- anonymiser.pl (basic anonymising proxy)

The way the filters are implemented is very likely to change in
the next version of HTTP::Proxy. Expect a dedicated filter class
to appear soon, as well as some slight changes in the HTTP::Proxy
interfaces. Maybe in 0.09 or 0.10.
