HTTP::Proxy
-----------

This module is a pure Perl HTTP proxy.

Its main use should be to record and/or modify web sessions, so as to
help users create web robots, web testing suites, as well as proxy
systems than can transparently alter the requests to and answers from
an origin server.

The eg/ directory holds a few examples:
- proxy.pl (simple proxy)
- anonymiser.pl (basic anonymising proxy)
- leet.pl (leet speak)
- outline.pl (keeps only the outline of web pages)
- rainbow.pl (the hippie browsing experience)
- rot13.pl (simple encryption for web pages)

The way the filters are implemented has changed in this version
of HTTP::Proxy. You can now play with two dedicated filter classes
and notice slight changes in the HTTP::Proxy interface.
