Revision history for Perl extension HTTP::Proxy

0.08  Thu Mar 13 01:41:42 CET 2003
        - cleaned up support for filters
        - added support for "buffering" filters
          and a new HTTP::Proxy::FilterStack class
        - added an anonymiser script (eg/anonymiser.pl)
        - the tests won't break if a local proxy is configured
        - the interfaces are very likely to change soon

        - the proxy now supports persistent connexions (Yay!)
        - and tests to check for it
        - and a new timeout accessor

        - better forking system and better reaping of zombies
          (thanks to David Landgren and Stéphane Payrard)
          Still won't work under Windows, though :-(
        - replaced verbose() by logmask(), so as to fine-tune
          the logging system
        - put some of the test functions in a test module (t::Utils)

        - explicitely refuse CONNECT
        - better support for TRACE method
        - support the Via: Header (a MUST in RFC 2616)
        - filters, but this needs more work

0.04  Sat Nov 30 12:19:22 CET 2002
        - accept connection from other hosts
        - better ftp support (no test yet)
        - basic gopher support (no test yet)
        - better HTTP error handling
        - use CRLF in HTTP headers

0.03  Fri Nov 29 11:17:36 CET 2002
        - url() method gives a url to reach the proxy
        - new 'control' attribute defines the control URL
        - better subprocess management by preforking child processes
          (thanks to Eric Cholet)
        - a children handles only one request at a time, for better
          performance (this means we only do HTTP/1.0 for now)
        - correctly handle the Proxy-Connection and Connection headers

0.02  Thu Oct 24 23:45:08 CEST 2002
        - the system now forks to handle several connections
        - but needs better test suites

0.01  Tue Oct  1 11:54:07 CEST 2002
        - original version
